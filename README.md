## 🧠 What is ASHES?

**ASHES by AROICE™** is a browser extension that replaces your default new tab page with a live countdown of your remaining time, based on your birthdate and expected lifespan.

- 🕰️ **Memento Mori** — A persistent reminder that life is finite, and every second matters
- 🧘 **Intentional Browsing** — Transform mindless browsing into moments of reflection
- 🎨 **Minimalist Design** — Clean, distraction-free interface focused on what truly matters

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 📊 Time Visualization:

- **Live Countdown** — See your remaining time visualized in real time
- **Personalized Calculation** — Based on your birthdate and expected lifespan
- **Multiple Units** — View your life in years, months, days, hours, or seconds

### 🔧 Customization:

- **Light & Dark Mode** — Choose the theme that suits your preference
- **Inspirational Quotes** — Philosophical reminders from stoic thinkers
- **Privacy-Focused** — All your data stays on your device, no tracking
